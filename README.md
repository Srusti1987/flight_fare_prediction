Flight Fare Prediction Webapp 

This is a machine learning project that predict flight fares. As the original data derived from India, the currency used is Rupee.
Thanks to Nikhil Mittal who uploaded the dataset on Kaggle, you can access it here:

Two webapps are develop from this repository using the same algorithm Random Forest Regressor:
1. A webapp that is not including columns with categorical data as part of the prediction
https://sitizzz-flight-fare-prediction-noohe-flight-pred-webapp-osrtgr.streamlit.app/
The accuracy of this model is 71%.

2. A webapp that is including columns with categorical data as part of the prediction
https://sitizzz-flight-fare-prediction-flight-pred-webapp-dvwdmt.streamlit.app/
The accuracy of this model is 81%.

I try to delete the first webapp but unfortunately streamlit is asking to delete the main project, which include the second webapp. 
So, I just let both webapp running on the cloud.
